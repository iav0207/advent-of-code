Desc Decoding a list of numbers by moving every number _its value_ positions along the list. Pretty difficult ring indexing logic. But the biggest trouble was the fact that list items weren't unique ðŸ™ˆ. Check the inputs!

Execution

```bash
make < input.txt
```

Output

```
make run
kotlinc -script Advent20.kts
Part 1: 3346
```
