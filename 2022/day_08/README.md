Spec https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8

Desc Finding the best viewing spot in the elf forest. Running max, axes, coordinates.

The code is really messy, cuz I was trying to solve it as fast as I could and did not apply any meaningful abstraction (2d array, 2d point, direction, etc.) in the first part of the solution.

Execution

```bash
./advent_08.py < input.txt
```

Output

```
Part 1: 1647 trees are visible
Part 2: Max scenic score is 392080
```
