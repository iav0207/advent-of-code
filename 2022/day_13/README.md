Desc Comparing nested packets of integers, sorting the packets. Recursion, comparators.

Tried to solve in JavaScript, got stuck idk where (the example passes, answer given on the input is wrong). Solved from scratch in Python, worked like a charm. The problem is not complicated. I think I got sucked in some `undefined` problems in JavaScript, or maybe some code branch did not return a value when it was supposed to ðŸ¤·.

Execution

```bash
./advent_13.py < input.txt
```

Output

```
Part 1: 5013
Part 2: 25038
```
