Spec https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20

Fancy infinite image enhancement technology.

Quite a stupid and head-on approach, runs forever,
just wanted to get it done quickly.

Execution

```bash
./advent_20.py < input.txt
```

Output

```
5475 pixels are lit after step 2.
17548 pixels are lit after step 50.
```
