Desc Reconstructing a 3D picture of beacons in the ocean using partial readings from misoriented misaligned scanners.

We have a number of misoriented misaligned scanners that read a partial picture of beacons
in the ocean (in 3 dimensions). We're reconstructing the whole picture and counting the beacons.

_Beacons of Hell_.

(This was a tough one)

Execution

```bash
./advent_19.py < input.txt
```

Output

```
The scanners see 462 beacons in total.
Max Manhattan distance between two scanners is 12158
```
