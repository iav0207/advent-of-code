Spec https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12

Desc Counting possible arrangements of patterns in a string with wildcard characters. Dynamic programming. Good kata to practice repeatedly.

I could not solve part 2 on my own and ended up looking at other people's solutions.
I found [this one](https://github.com/eagely/adventofcode/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/solutions/y2023/Day12.kt) especially elegant
and took its approach.

Execution

```bash
make < input.txt
```

Output

```
Part 1: 7922
Part 2: 18093821750095
```
