Desc Matching messages against recursive rules (finite state automaton).

Execution

```bash
make < input.txt
```

Output

```
Part 1: 224
```

Part 2 is not solved, the initial approach was quite unfortunate.
What I needed to create was a state automaton that allows for loops,
the problem is essentially a basic version of regex matching.
Maybe I'll get to redo it later.
